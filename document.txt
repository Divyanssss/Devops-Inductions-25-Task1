My approach was simple: learn the syntax of Docker, then just search how to make individual images of the respective containers.

I faced some challenges. The most prominent of them all was that the Backend was not running properly.
Also, I don't know Rust, so for days I would just do random things - 
change compiler versions and make shell scripts containing all the commands required to run the backend normally. 
I'd paste the errors into AI and it would just say "check the logs" ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.

Then I just simply searched on google "why is my backend not running?" There was a list of suggestion one 
the backend was only listening inside the container. So I changed that in main.rs, and It also said to change "localhost" to "backend" in the frontend, so I changed the proxy in 
package-lock.json. Finally, the Error 500 was gone and the app started working.
